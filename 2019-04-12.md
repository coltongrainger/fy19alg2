### Ideas behind the fundamental theorem of Galois theory

Recall: in favorable conditions, the degree $\abs{\Aut{K/F}} \le [K: F]$. If $K/F$ is Galois, then we have equality.

Let $K/F$ be a Galois extension over a field $F$. \TFAE.

- The automorphism group $\Aut{K/F}$ is "sufficiently big".
- The action of $\Aut{K/F}$ on $K$ has stabilizer subgroup $\Stab{\Aut{K/F}}{F} = \Aut{K/F}$.
- $\abs{\Aut{K/F}} = [K:F]$.

The fundamental theorem of Galois theory claims that there's a *bijective* and *order-reversing* correspondence between the subfields of $K/F$ and the subgroups of $\Gal{K/F}$.

For example, the groups lattice of subgroups $1 \le H \le G$ corresponds to the lattice of field extensions $K \ge E \ge F$. That is:
$$\xymatrix{

    K\ar{-}[rr]& & 1\ar[d]\\
    E\ar{-}[rr] \ar[u]& & H\ar[d]\\
    F\ar{-}[rr] \ar[u]& & G}$$
the degree of $K/E$ is $H$, with 

Moreover, $[E:F] = [G:H]$. $K/E$ is also Galois, with $\Gal{K/E} = H$.

$$E \qq{ is Galois over $F$ iff} H \qq{is normal in} G.$$



### Example $\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)$.

Recall that the minimal polynomial of $\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)$ over $\QQ$ is $x^3 - 2$. 

We have the tower of extensions \TODO. Consider that $\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}) \le  \QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)$, but there's $\sigma \in \Aut{\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)/\QQ}$  that takes $\sigma(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})) = \QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}\omega)$. (In other words, the fields $\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}\omega^k)$ for $k = 0,1,2$ correspond to the $2$-cycles in $S_3$.

### Lattice isomorphisms

What's the largest subfield contained in the subfields $E_1, E_2$ of $K$? It's the intersection. How about the largest subfield containing both $E_1$ and $E_2$? It's the composite in $K$. Correspondingly, for the subgroups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of $\Aut{K/F}$ fixing $E_1$ and $E_2$, the subgroup $G_1 \cap G_2$ fixes the composite, and the subgroup $\langle G_1, G_2\rangle$ fixes the intersection. \TODO

### Finite fields

Exercise: prove that the algebraic closure of a field is an infinite degree extension.

Fact: consider the algebraic closure $\FF_p^a$ of $\FF_p$. Since $\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p$ is an algebraic extension, we have $$\FF_{p^n} \qq{ contained in } \FF_p^a.$$

Idea: there *is* a *non-algebraic* extension of $\CC$, e.g., $\CC(t)$, the polynomial ring.

Consider that $\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p$ is an algebraic extension, since $\FF_{p^n}$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^n} - x$ over $\FF_p$. Whence $\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p$ is a *Galois* extension. So also 
$$\abs{\Gal{\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p}} = n.$$ 

Consider the Froebenius automorphism $\Phi\colon \FF_{p^n} \to \FF_p$ defined by $\Phi(a) = a^p$. Note (by Fermat's little theorem) $\Phi$ fixes $\FF_p$ (this in general holds for prime subfields). Now we have $$\Phi \in \Gal{\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p} \qq{ and } \Phi^k = \id \qq{iff} n \mid k.$$

\pf If $\Phi^k = \id$, then $\alpha^{p^k} -\alpha = 0$ for all $\alpha \in \FF_{p^n}$. But there are not enough roots! \TODO\ tighten up. \qedsymbol

Thus $\Gal{\FF_{p^n}/\FF_p}$ is cyclic, finitely generated by $\Phi$.

Consider the tower $\FF_{p^n} \ge \FF_{p^k} \ge \FF_p$. The degrees of the extensions are $n/k$ and $k$ respectively, where we *must have* $k \mid n$. The corresponding subgroups are $1 \le \text{cyclic of order $n/k$} \le \text{cyclic of order $n$}$. The generators are thence $\langle \Phi^n\rangle \le \langle \Phi^k \rangle \le \langle \Phi \rangle$. 

\pf (Consider Lagrange's theorem.)

Moral. What Galois groups can appear as automorphism groups of extensions of finite fields? Only cyclic groups.

### Example $\QQ(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \QQ(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})$.

### Consider $\FF_{p^n}$, a *simple *extension of $\FF_p$.

\pf Let $\alpha$ be a generator of $\FF_{p^n}^\times$. Since the finite subgroups of the group of units of a field is cyclic, and the group $\FF_{p^n}^\times$ *is finite*. Then $\FF_{p^n} = \FF_p(\alpha)$. 

But how to find $\alpha$? 

- Randomly? (c.f. stackexchange.)
- Observe that the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ (such that $\FF_p(\alpha)$ is a degree $n$ extension) has degree $n$. 
- Proposition. \TODO\ For any $n$, there's a irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ over $\FF_p$.

Consider the tower
$$\xymatrix{
    \FF_{p^n} = \FF_p(\alpha) \ar[d] \\
    E = \FF_p(\beta) \ar[d] \\
    \FF_p}$$

With the degree of $\alpha$ equal to $n$, and the degree of $\beta$ equal to $d$, we have $d \mid n$. 
But also the minimal polynomials $m_\alpha(x)$ and $m_\beta(x)$ both *divide* $x^{p^n} - x \in \FF_{p}[x]$.


\pf Suppose $m(x)$ is an irreducible factor of $x^{p^n} -x$. Let $\gamma$ be a root of $m(x)$ in $\FF_{p^n}$ of degree $d$. Consider:
$$\xymatrix{
    \FF_{p^n} \ar[dd]^n \ar[dr]^{n/d} & \\
    & \FF_p(\gamma) \ar[dl]^d \\
    \FF_p &}$$
Thence $d\mid n$. 

Conversely, if we have an irreducible polynomial of degree $d$ over $\FF_p$ and $d\mid n$, then every element of $\FF_p(\gamma)$ has degree dividing $d$. $$\gamma^{p^d} - \gamma = 0 \quad \gamma \in \FF_{p^d}.$$

### Example. Factorize $x^8 - x$ over $\FF_2$.

Consider $x^{2^3} -x$. We've a degree $8$ polynomial. So consider
\begin{align*}
x^8 - x &= x(x^ -1)\\
    &= x (x -1) (x^6 + x^5 + \cdots + 1).
\end{align*}

What a chore?! Instead with $p =2$ and $n= 3$. We've have a table

poly | irreduc?
--- | ---
$x^3 + 1$ | no ($-1$ is a root)
$x^3 +x^2 + 1$ |  yes
$x^3 + x + 1$ | yes
$x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ | no  ($-1$ is a root)

Therefore $x(x+1)(x^3 + x + 1)(x^3+ x^2 + 1) = x^8 -x$. \qedsymbol

### Example $x^4 + 1 \in \ZZ[x]$.

\TODO\ Show that this polynomial is reducible, but modulo any prime $p$, irreducible.
