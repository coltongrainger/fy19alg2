EX: $M$ is an $R$-module ... $M$ is a vector space over $R$
EX: $m$ is an element of $M$ ... $m$ is a vector in $M$
EX: $\alpha$ is a ring element ... $\alpha$ is a scalar
EX: $N$ is a submodule of $M$ ... $N$ is a subspace of $M$
EX: $M/N$ is a quotient module ... $M/N$ is a quotient space
EX: $M$ is a free module of rank $n$ ... $M$ is a vector space of dimension $n$ 
EX: $M$ is a finitely generated module ... $M$ is a finite dimensional vector space 
EX: $M$ is a nonzero cyclic module ... $M$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space
EX: $\phi \colon M \to N$ is an $R$-module homomorphism  ... $\phi \colon M \to N$ is a linear transformation
EX: $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic as $R$-modules ... $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic as vector space 
EX: the subset $A$ of $M$ generates $M$ ... the subset $A$ of $M$ spans $M$
EX: $M = RA$ ... each element of $M$ is a linear combination of elements of $A$
